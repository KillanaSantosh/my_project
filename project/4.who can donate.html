    <p>
        Most people can give blood if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor.  Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:



You are aged between 18 and 65.<br>

* In some countries national legislation permits 16–17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is obtained.<br>

* In some countries, regular donors over the age of 65 may be accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician. The upper age limit in some countries are 60.<br>

<br>
<h3>Weight:</h3><br>

You weigh at least 50 kg.    <br>

* In some countries, donors of whole blood donations should weigh at least 45 kg to donate 350 ml ± 10% .<br>


<h3>Health: </h3>     <br>

You must be in good health at the time you donate.<br>

You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.<br>

If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.  If the body piercing was performed by a registered health professional and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate blood after 12 hours.
<br>
If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.
<br>
You must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for blood donation
<br>
* A test will be administered at the donation site. In many countries, a haemoglobin level of not less than 12.0 g/dl for females and not less than 13.0 g/dl for males as the threshold.
